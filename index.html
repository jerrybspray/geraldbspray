    <p style = "color: white; font-family: verdana; padding-left: 570px; font-size: 16px; width: 900px; position: absolute;">Normally I don't watch crime dramas, or movies that require reading subtitles. But trust me, "A Better Tomorrow" is worth getting 
      out of your comfort zone for. On the surface, it's an ultra-violent gangster movie. However, it's really a story about family, and how far a person can go for it, even when it's against the law.
<br>
      <br>
      Sung Tse-Ho, a gang member who deals with counterfeit US dollars, has a younger brother, Sung Tse-Kit, who is an aspiring police officer. After turning himself in, Ho vows never to 
      return to a life of crime. It's not that simple, though - Mark Lee, his best friend and former business partner, wants him to do exactly that. Ho must choose between being loyal to his friend
       and being accepted by his brother, who is hell-bent on tracking down his organization.
      <br>
      <br>
      One of the reasons I don't watch crime dramas often is because I have trouble keeping track of all the details. Thankfully, this film revolves around characterization, making it relatively easy to follow. Even though 
      the dialogue is in Cantonese (mostly), you can feel the raw emotion. 
      <br>
      <br>
      Credit should also be given to the energetic pace, brought on by the slick action sequences and synthesized soundtrack. "A Better Tomorrow" is considered a landmark in Hong Kong cinema, and it's easy to see why. While it isn't <i>my</i> kind of movie, 
      there is just about nothing I can say to bring it down.

  <p style = "color: white; font-family: verdana; padding-left: 570px; font-size: 16px; width: 900px; position: absolute;">Although I'm a Stephen King fan, I was debating whether I should watch this movie at all, since it's an anthology film. That means that there are 
    three 30-minute segments instead of a full 90-minute story.
    <br>
    <br>
    I'm glad I did. "Cat's Eye" had me entertained for the majority of its runtime, even when shifting from one story to another. The first is called "Quitters, Inc", based on a short story from Stephen King's "Night Shift". It features James Woods as a smoker who looks to 
    get help from an anti-smoking organization. This organization, however, is sketchier than he thought. Its members promise to spy on him around the clock, making threats if he ever tries to sneak a cigarette.
    <br>
    <br>
    The second is called "The Ledge", also based on a "Night Shift" story. It involves a man in an affair with a woman whose husband is a mobster. In revenge, the mobster forces him to either climb around the top ledge of a skyscraper, or get framed for possession of cocaine. 
    This is probably my favorite of the three stories - the mobster tries to find ways to make the man slip off the ledge, such as distracting him with a horn or using a hose. I found it both dark and funny. Not to mention, practical effects are used well to convey height, adding a  real 
    sense of tension.

    My least favorite is probably "General" - it stars Drew Barrymore as a little girl who is afraid of a monster hiding in her house. A cat named General concerns her parents, since they think he will eat their pet bird. But he defends the little girl from the monster. 
    While this segment was cute, I could tell that it was the only one not based on a Stephen King story - it feels generic, relying on the basic "monster-under-the-bed" fear that children have. Even so, I recommend this movie on the strength of the first
    two stories.

  <p style = "color: white; font-family: verdana; padding-left: 570px; font-size: 16px; width: 900px; position: absolute;">Critics panned this movie in 2001. But sometimes, critics attack movies because they don't understand the artistic statement they're trying
    to make.
    <br>
    <br>
    I'm actually not kidding. "Freddy Got Fingered" predicted Generation Z's sense of humor. It follows Tom Green as an aspiring cartoonist who moves back into his parents' house, where he annoys his father with his antics.
    These include absurdist moments such as wearing scuba gear in the shower, as well as connecting a strange sausage contraption to a piano. It all reminds me of internet memes, only this movie was released at a time when half the country didn't have the internet.
    <br>
    <br>
    Just about the only jokes I don't like in the movie are the ones that rely on physical violence. A child getting hit by an airplane propeller isn't funny, and neither is the protagonist threatening 
    to shoot himself when he doesn't land a cartooning job. Even so, I was entertained for the majority of the runtime. The style of humor may be lowbrow, but sometimes you have to be smart to be stupid, and I think Tom Green succeeded
    in what he set out to do.

<p style = "color: white; font-family: verdana; padding-left: 570px; font-size: 16px; width: 900px; position: absolute;">"The Monster Squad" didn't get very much attention 
  upon release, but has garnered a cult following in the past few decades. Honestly, it feels to me like a second-rate version of "The Goonies" (1985). Like the Goonies, 
  the Monster Squad are an unsupervised group of kids racing after the bad guys for a hidden treasure. Only this time, the bad guys are classic monsters such as the Wolf Man, Count Dracula, and the
  Creature from the Black Lagoon.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hidden treasure is a magic amulet, which controls the balance between good and evil. If placed into the hands of Dracula's army, the forces of evil could rule the world. But the Monster Squad
   works with an old man known as "Scary German Guy", who can read Van Helsing's diary, the secret to banishing the monsters to another dimension.
  <br>
  <br>
  At 82 minutes, the movie doesn't have time to be boring - the action is well-directed, skillfully using practical effects. But because many of the elements are borrowed from other movies, it has a disposable quality. 
  The characters are difficult to care about - Horace, the fat kid, is too similar to Chunk from "The Goonies", while Frankenstein's monster plays a similar role to Sloth. "The Monster Squad" isn't a bad movie, but it falls 
  into the realm of mindless entertainment.

  <p style = "color: white; font-family: verdana; padding-left: 570px; font-size: 16px; width: 900px; position: absolute;">"Spider-Man 3" is the red-headed stepchild of Sam Raimi's trilogy. Fans hate on it for several reasons - the CGI looks worse than in the previous two films, 
    Tobey Maguire is unintentionally funny as black-suit Spider-Man, and the movie tries to cram in several villains at once. While I'll admit that it's flawed, I still found myself entertained. 
    <br>
    <br>
    In this installment, everything seems to be going right for Peter Parker - that is, until an alien symbiote takes over his suit, amplifying his aggression. This causes him to seek vengeance on the Sandman, who is responsible for killing his uncle. He begins 
    having relationship drama with Mary Jane, while Harry Osborn uses the leftover Green Goblin technology to avenge his father. 
    <br>
    <br>
    At 2 hours and 19 minutes, this is the longest of the original series. Because of this, the multiple villains didn't bother me. Tobey Maguire could have done a better job at his personality change when the symbiote takes over his 
    suit - he has several meme-worthy moments, such as doing his classic "Bully Maguire" dance. CGI is also more heavily relied on, making some of the fight scenes look silly. But even though it isn't as consistent as the first two installments, it's nowhere near
     as bad as its reputation suggests. It tells a compelling story, and for that, I think it deserves a critical reevaluation.

  <p style = "color: white; font-family: verdana; padding-left: 570px; font-size: 16px; width: 900px; position: absolute;">When I was a kid, my parents strictly followed the MPAA rating system when it came to what movies I could watch. 
    So of <i>course</i> I would want to see a movie dedicated to criticizing it. "This Film is Not Yet Rated" collects interviews of directors frustrated with how the MPAA has interfered with their filmmaking. Trey Parker, for instance, 
    highlights the difficulties he experienced submitting "South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut" (1999), which came back multiple times with an NC-17 rating. Many theaters won't show NC-17 films, due to the perception that they mean 
    pornography. This is a problem, because movies like "South Park" were being slapped with the rating merely based on bad language.
    <br>
    <br>
    Private investigator Becky Altringer works to decode the set of standards the MPAA operates on, and why they exist. Jack Valenti, the former head of the rating system, intended for parents to be recruited for rating movies, 
    but what Altringer finds is that many of the parents have grown older, to the point that they no longer raise their children. This leads to the assertion that the raters are out of touch. Additionally, Altringer uncovers the 
    Republican and Christian bias of the MPAA. What this leads to is an analysis of the overall impact on how movies are rated, including strict judgement toward sex and language, lenient judgement toward violence, and other backwards rules.

    I normally don't watch documentaries, but I was thoroughly entertained by this one. Even though it heavily relies on footage from other movies, it manages to feel fresh. To be honest, some of the sexual content made me a little bit uncomfortable, 
    but that stands as a testament to the impact the rating system has on American culture.

  <p style = "color: white; font-family: verdana; padding-left: 570px; font-size: 16px; width: 900px; position: absolute;">When people talk about "Twister", they're usually referring to the 1996 film, and there's a 
    good reason for that. 
    
    This 1989 film tries to be both a comedy and a drama, and succeeds at neither. Even though the title is "Twister",
    
    the movie is less about a tornado, and more a series of events happening during tornado season. These events 
    
    surround the eccentric Cleveland family, who live in a mansion in Kansas. There's a retired soft drink tycoon, who uses 
    his proceeds to support his daughter Maureen. She wants to raise her child elsewhere, away from kooky characters such as 
    Howdy, an absurdist art student. Meanwhile, her ex wants to get back together with her.
    <br>
    <br>
    I have a confession to make. I used Wikipedia to help me with that summary, because I just wasn't invested enough to keep track
    of all the family drama. Maureen doesn't feel like a real human being, instead feeling cut and pasted from a TV soap opera. Characters 
    such as Howdy add some comic relief, but it feels added in just for the sake of having it.
    <br>
    <br>
   
    I'm surprised that high-profile actors such as Harry Dean Stanton were convinced to be in this movie. My advice? Stick with the 1996 blockbuster.

  <p style = "color: white; font-family: verdana; padding-left: 570px; font-size: 16px; width: 900px; position: absolute;">Movies like "Wish Upon" are difficult to review. While this is objectively a bad movie, I couldn't help but enjoy it. Joey King stars as a teenage girl who comes across a 
    Chinese music box that magically grants wishes. But for every wish that she makes, someone close to her has to die, and making seven wishes will kill her.
    <br>
    <br>
    The protagonist is not particularly likeable. Instead of wishing for things such as world peace, which her friends encourage her to do, she makes selfish wishes, such as for her crush to become obsessed with her. The resulting deaths border on ridiculous - at one point, a character trips and 
    falls in a dark room, impaling her head on a conveniently placed bull statue. It doesn't help that the CGI effects look cheap, and that the violence is awkwardly edited to get a PG-13 rating. 
    <br>
    <br>
    As a horror film, "Wish Upon" fails in what it sets out to do - it isn't scary at all. It does, however, have a "B-movie" charm, and while I can't call it a <i>good</i> movie, I had a good time poking fun at it, and that has to count for something.
