    <p style = "color: white; font-family: verdana; padding-left: 570px; font-size: 16px; width: 900px; position: absolute;">Normally I don't watch crime dramas, or movies that require reading subtitles. But trust me, "A Better Tomorrow" is worth getting 
      out of your comfort zone for. On the surface, it's an ultra-violent gangster movie. However, it's really a story about family, and how far a person can go for it, even when it's against the law.
<br>
      <br>
      Sung Tse-Ho, a gang member who deals with counterfeit US dollars, has a younger brother, Sung Tse-Kit, who is an aspiring police officer. After turning himself in, Ho vows never to 
      return to a life of crime. It's not that simple, though - Mark Lee, his best friend and former business partner, wants him to do exactly that. Ho must choose between being loyal to his friend
       and being accepted by his brother, who is hell-bent on tracking down his organization.

  <p style = "color: white; font-family: verdana; padding-left: 570px; font-size: 16px; width: 900px; position: absolute;">When people talk about "Twister", they're usually referring to the 1996 film, and there's a 
    good reason for that. 
    
    This 1989 film tries to be both a comedy and a drama, and succeeds at neither. Even though the title is "Twister",
    
    the movie is less about a tornado, and more a series of events happening during tornado season. These events 
    
    surround the eccentric Cleveland family, who live in a mansion in Kansas. There's a retired soft drink tycoon, who uses 
    his proceeds to support his daughter Maureen. She wants to raise her child elsewhere, away from kooky characters such as 
    Howdy, an absurdist art student. Meanwhile, her ex wants to get back together with her.
    <br>
    <br>
    I have a confession to make. I used Wikipedia to help me with that summary, because I just wasn't invested enough to keep track
    of all the family drama. Maureen doesn't feel like a real human being, instead feeling cut and pasted from a TV soap opera. Characters 
    such as Howdy add some comic relief, but it feels added in just for the sake of having it.
    <br>
    <br>
   
    I'm surprised that high-profile actors such as Harry Dean Stanton were convinced to be in this movie. My advice? Stick with the 1996 blockbuster.
