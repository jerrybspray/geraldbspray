  <p style = "color: white; font-family: verdana; padding-left: 570px; font-size: 14px; width: 1100px; position: absolute;">When people talk about "Twister", they're usually referring to the 1996 film, and there's a 
    good reason for that. 
    
    This 1989 film tries to be both a comedy and a drama, and succeeds at neither. Even though the title is "Twister",
    
    the movie is less about a tornado, and more a series of events happening during tornado season. These events 
    
    surround the Cleveland family, who live in a mansion in Kansas. 
    <br>
    <br>
    I have a confession to make. I couldn't keep track of all the family drama, because I didn't care. The characters
    
    don't feel like real human beings, making any attempt at humor feel contrived. At times, I felt like I was watching 
    
    a drama with comedy elements thrown in just for the sake of having them. 
    <br>
    <br>
   
    My advice? Stick with the 1996 blockbuster.
