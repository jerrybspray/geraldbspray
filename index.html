  <p style = "color: white; font-family: verdana; padding-left: 570px; font-size: 16px; width: 900px; position: absolute;">When people talk about "Twister", they're usually referring to the 1996 film, and there's a 
    good reason for that. 
    
    This 1989 film tries to be both a comedy and a drama, and succeeds at neither. Even though the title is "Twister",
    
    the movie is less about a tornado, and more a series of events happening during tornado season. These events 
    
    surround the eccentric Cleveland family, who live in a mansion in Kansas. There's a retired soft drink tycoon, who uses 
    his proceeds to support his daughter Maureen. She wants to raise her child elsewhere, away from kooky characters such as 
    Howdy, an absurdist art student. Meanwhile, her ex wants to get back together with her.
    <br>
    <br>
    I have a confession to make. I used Wikipedia to help me with that summary, because I just wasn't invested enough to keep track
    of all the family drama. Maureen doesn't feel like a real human being, instead feeling cut and pasted from a TV soap opera. Characters 
    such as Howdy add some comic relief, but it feels added in just for the sake of having it.
    <br>
    <br>
   
    I'm surprised that high-profile actors such as Harry Dean Stanton were convinced to be in this movie. My advice? Stick with the 1996 blockbuster.
